    <h1>Inequalities</h1>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>In inequalities, there is going to be just a few examples to exemplify the importance of inequalities in Math. Later on, you will need this knowledge for future challenging problems. For now, enjoy what you are about to see. Example:</p>
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality.png' %}">
    <p>No special treatment. The >= sign is not different than the = sign. Solve it as if it were a normal equation. </p>
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality1.png' %}">
    <p>Special Treatment. In this situation, when we are dividing numbers with negative sign in inequalities, evertyhing changes. The orientation changes and we divide normally.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality2.png' %}">
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality3.png' %}">
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality4.png' %}">
    <p>Our solution is an entire set of numbers that are less or equal than -3. This is how looks like in a graph to better exemplify the solution.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality5.png' %}">
    <h3>Example 2:</h3>
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality_.png' %}">
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality_1.png' %}">
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality_2.png' %}">
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality_3.png' %}">
    <img src="{% static 'inequality/inequality_4.png' %}">
    <p>Notes: In this example notice the > orientation did not change, this is because x has no - sign. So we solve this equation as if it were a regular equation. The dotted line in the graph means that 1/3 is not included in the solution, it is just a reference to our set of solutions.</p>
